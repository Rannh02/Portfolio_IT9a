        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm a 21-year-old third-year Information Technology student at the University of Mindanao, 
            born on October 13, 2003, and proudly calling Davao City, Philippines, my home. Growing up in 
            this lively and vibrant community, I've developed a deep passion for technology and its power 
            to connect people, spark innovation, and transform ideas into reality. This curiosity has fueled 
            my pursuit of web development, a field where creativity meets technical precision to craft 
            meaningful digital experiences.</p><br><br>
        <p>As an IT student, I'm immersed in the exciting world of building websites and web applications. 
            From designing responsive layouts with HTML and CSS to mastering the logic of JavaScript and 
            exploring backend technologies, I thrive on turning concepts into user-friendly, functional 
            solutions. The University of Mindanao has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, 
            database management, and system design. Yet, I believe the real growth happens through hands-on 
            projects, late-night coding sessions, and the thrill of solving complex bugs.</p><br><br>
        <p>Beyond my academic journey, I'm a musician assistant to the band leader and serve as the section 
            leader of the woodwinds section. Music, much like coding, is a creative outlet where precision 
            and collaboration harmonize to create something beautiful. These roles have taught me leadership,
             teamwork, and the art of balancing creativity with discipline—skills I bring to my tech endeavors.</p><br><br>
        <p>At 21, I see every challenge as a chance to grow. Whether it's learning a new framework, integrating
             APIs, or staying ahead of web development trends, I'm eager to expand my skills and push my 
             boundaries. I love collaborating with peers, brainstorming innovative solutions, and staying 
             updated with the latest tech advancements. My goal is to become a skilled web developer 
             who crafts impactful, accessible, and seamless online experiences that leave a lasting 
             impression.</p><br><br>
        <p>When I'm not coding or rehearsing with the band, you might find me exploring new hobbies, 
            connecting with friends, or soaking in the vibrant culture of Davao City. Driven by a 
            desire to contribute to the tech and music communities, I aim to inspire others and
             make a mark in the digital world—one line of code and one note at a time. Thank you for 
             getting to know me, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next!</p>
