        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm a 21-year-old third-year Information Technology student at the 
            University of Mindanao, passionate about unraveling the endless possibilities 
            of technology. Growing up in the vibrant and dynamic community of Davao, Philippines, 
            I've always been curious about how the digital world connects people, ideas, and innovation. 
            This curiosity has driven me to pursue a degree in IT, where I'm diving deep into 
            the fascinating realm of web development—a field that blends creativity, problem-solving, 
            and technical expertise.</p><br><br>
        <p>As a student, I'm constantly learning and honing my skills in building websites and web 
            applications. From crafting responsive layouts with HTML and CSS to exploring the logic 
            of JavaScript and backend technologies, I'm excited to be on this journey of turning ide
            as into functional, user-friendly digital experiences. The University of Mindanao has pr
            ovided me with a solid foundation in programming, database management, and system design
            , but I believe the true learning happens through hands-on projects, late-night coding s
            essions, and the occasional debugging marathon.</p><br><br>
        <p>At 21, I'm at a stage where every challenge is an opportunity to grow. Whether it's mastering 
            a new framework, understanding APIs, or keeping up with the ever-evolving trends in web devel
            opment, I'm eager to soak up knowledge and push my limits. Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborat
            ing with peers, brainstorming innovative solutions, and staying updated with the latest tech
             advancements. My goal is to become a skilled web developer who creates impactful, accessibl
             e, and seamless online experiences that make a difference.</p><br><br>
        <p>When I'm not glued to my laptop, you might find me exploring new hobbies, connecting with friends, 
            or simply enjoying the vibrant culture of Mindanao. I'm driven by a desire to contribute t
            o the tech community, inspire others, and leave a mark in the digital world—one line of code a
            t a time. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, and I’m excited to see where this t
            ech journey takes me next!</p>
